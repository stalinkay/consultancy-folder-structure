# Design
The name says it all. Hereâ€™s where you keep your actual design files, the stuff you work on. Typically, it should contain nothing else but a list of files with your designs in various versions or revision stages. Remember, all files used to construct those designs, like photos or icons, should go into the Assets folder.
